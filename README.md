Termpaper written for Algorithms and Data Structures Course
==================================================================

Here, we benchmark the runtimes of 2 inbuilt sort algorithms, and 3 other sort algorithms written in python.
We attempt to prove that all of their runtimes are of the order of theta- n*log(n).
The proof would look more solid if we had collected at least 5 more data points of increasing list sizes.
However, as we were running on our own personal PCs, the largest numerical list we have consists of 10.48 floating point numbers.
